# Speech to Text for Transcription Services

This project implements a **Speech-to-Text** system for transcription services using Python and various speech recognition tools. It allows users to upload audio files, convert them into text, and optionally perform further analysis or formatting on the transcribed content.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation, including data processing, speech recognition, and text output.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and usage guide.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload and transcribe audio files (e.g., WAV, MP3).
- Uses Python libraries such as `speech_recognition`, `pydub`, and others.
- Simple and modular notebook structure for easy experimentation.
- Can be extended for use in real-time transcription, meeting summaries, and more.

## 🔧 Requirements

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

**Main Libraries:**

* `speechrecognition`
* `pydub`
* `wave`
* `IPython.display`
* `os`, `io`, `sys`

> Note: You may need to install `ffmpeg` if using non-WAV audio formats.

## 💡 Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb
```

2. Upload or record an audio file.
3. Run the cells to process the audio and generate the transcribed text.

## 📌 Notes

* Accuracy may vary depending on audio quality and background noise.
* For better results, consider using high-quality microphones or preprocessing techniques.
* Currently supports English; support for other languages can be added using language-specific models.
